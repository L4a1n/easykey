My own try on a local stored PW manager cause clouds are just someone else his computers

# How come I started creating my own PW manager ?
Soo...I personally never used a real PW manager other than the integrated one in Firefox and also I would have a password encrypted 7zip archive where I save all my credetials in.
But neither the Firefox PW manager is safe nor my archive, since if you got your hands the archive it would take at most a week to decrypt its contents.
And with Firefox you can literally extract all credentials in cleartext with little to no effort.
So thats why I want to make something better! (or atleast safer)

# What do I plan on using to create it ?
I plan on writing the whole thing in Python, since its the language im most comfortable with.
There is a neat library called "py7zr" wich I, at first considered on using, but those archives are still pretty easy to crack.
So I started to think of some other way to encrypt the credentials. (not that I found a good solution as of yet)

# What are my plans or the future ?
To create it as a localy stored programm with synchronization over peer-to-peer based framework, so that you always got your credentials on all of your devices up to date and ready to go.
Make some plugins for most browsers so that it can interact with your browser on an auto complete basis.


Yeah and thats it so far...
